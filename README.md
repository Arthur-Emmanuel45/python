This is python tutorials which showcase python commands. These commads are:
printing Hello world as first python program

Variable Creation - A variable is like a labeled box that stores information. You can change the contents of the box, but the label stays the same

Numeric Data types - exploring the basic data types that are used to store numeric values. these are int, float, complex and bool

Working with the String Data Type
Write Python code that uses the string data type, Concatenate Strings, Use the string to input and format strings for output

Woring with with Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
Python frequently uses string and numeric data types in groups called collections. Python supports three types of collections: lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Similar to a list, but immutable, is the tuple.An immutable data type is one that cannot be altered once it is created. Parentheses are used to define a tuple instead of brackets ([]).

A dictionary is a list with named positions (keys). Imagine that your list shows peopleâ€™s favorite fruit.

Categorizing Values - where list can be created with mix data types

Composite Data Types
A composite data type is any data type that comprises primitive data types

Working with Conditionals
Using conditional to create different paths - if, else, elif

Working with loops
Intro to while loop and for loop
A while loop repeatedly runs a section of code until a predetermined condition is satisfied. You will write a Python script in this exercise that challenges the user to guess a number correctly.
For loop - A programming control flow statement called a for loop is used to repeatedly run a block of code over a sequence of elements or for a predetermined number of times. Initialization, condition, and iteration are usually its three primary parts.
